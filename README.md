# Jammming - Spotify Playlist Maker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and built as part of the Codecademy Pro "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch" course.

Jammming is a React web application that lets users make and add playlists to their Spotify accounts. It accomplishes this by connecting to a user's account, authenticating the user, and searching for Tracks, Artists, or Albums using the Spotify API. Individual tracks can then be easily added to or removed from a new playlist when the results are shown in a list. The user can click a button after the playlist has been put together to give it a name and save it to their Spotify account.

## Features
- Spotify Authentication — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.
- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library.
- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a `+` sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a `-` sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
- Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.
